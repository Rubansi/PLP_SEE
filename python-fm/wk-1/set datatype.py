# The Set is an unordered collection of unique items. Set is defined by values separated by commas inside braces { }. For example,

student_ids = {112, 114, 117, 113}
print(student_ids)



# Here, we have created a set named student_info with 5 integer values.
# Since sets are unordered collections, indexing has no meaning. Hence, the slicing operator [] does not work.
